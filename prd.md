|-----------------|---------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| FR001          | Creating a New URL List   | As a user, I want to be able to start a new, empty list so I can begin adding URLs.              | The system should provide a clear way for the user to initiate the creation of a new list, potentially presenting an empty list view or an "add new list" button. |
| FR002          | Adding URLs to a List     | As a user, I want to be able to input or paste URLs into my list so I can compile the resources I want to share. | The system should provide an input field or mechanism for users to enter URLs. Upon submission, the URL should be added to the list.                              |
| FR003          | Viewing URLs in a List    | As a user, I want to be able to see all the URLs I have added to my list so I can review and manage them. | The system should display the list of added URLs, potentially with their automatically fetched titles and descriptions.                                           |
| FR004          | Editing URLs in a List    | As a user, I want to be able to edit a URL in my list if I made a mistake or if the link has changed. | The system should provide a way for users to modify the URL of an existing item in the list.                                                                      |
| FR005          | Deleting URLs from a List | As a user, I want to be able to remove a URL from my list if it's no longer relevant or if I added it by mistake. | The system should provide a mechanism for users to delete individual URLs from their list.                                                                        |
| FR006          | Customizing the List URL  | As a user, I want to be able to choose a custom URL for my list so it's easy to remember and share. | The system should provide an input field where users can specify their desired custom URL. It should also handle cases where the chosen URL is already taken.     |
| FR007          | Automatic URL Generation  | As a user, if I don't want to think of a custom URL, I want the system to automatically create one for my list so I can still share it. | The system should generate a unique and shareable URL for the list if the user doesn't provide one.                                                               |
| FR008          | Publishing a List         | As a user, I want to be able to publish my list so that others can view the collection of URLs.  | Upon publishing, the list should be saved and made publicly accessible at the associated URL.                                                                     |
| FR009          | Sharing a List            | As a user, I want to be able to easily share the link to my list with others through various channels. | The system should provide the user with the URL of their list, potentially with options for copying it.                                                           |
| FR010          | Accessing a Shared List   | As a recipient, I want to be able to view the collection of URLs by clicking on or entering the shared link. | When a user visits a The Urlist link, they should be presented with the list of URLs.                                                                             |
| FR011          | Viewing all lists         | As a user, I want to be able to see all the lists I have created so I can manage them easily.    | The system should provide a dashboard or overview page where users can see all their created lists.                                                               |
| FR012          | Deleting a List           | As a user, I want to be able to delete an entire list if I no longer need it.                    | The system should provide a way for users to delete their entire list, including all associated URLs.                                                             |
